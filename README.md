# DANBW Aikido Course Website
## A Django-based course registration website for Dynamic Aikido Nocquet BW (DANBW)
**Dynamic Aikido Nocquet BW** is an Aikido organization based in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The organization offers Aikido courses several times a year. Members of the organization can sign up for those courses.

This website aims at offering an easy and straightforward way for DANBW members to sign up for courses and manage their course registrations and exams. Furthermore the website allows DANBW staff members to manage courses and course registrations as well as the website content.

DANBW already has a [website](https://www.danbw.de), which is slowly becoming outdated. This project therefore aims at replacing the current website. The project replicated the most important features of the existing website, added a couple of new features and dropped some obsolete features.

The deployed version of the website can be found here: https://aikido-course-website-django-ddffe52bc952.herokuapp.com/

## Features
### Existing Features

#### User Accounts and Profiles
- Users can sign up to the website by providing an email address, a username and a password.
- Users need to confirm their email address, before being able to login to the website.
- After having confirmed their email address, users are asked to create a user profile with their full name and their current Aikido grade.
- Users can see their user profile on the **My Profile** page. From there, they can also update their information or delete their account, if they are regular users (Staff users cannot delete their accounts from the frontend, as a security measure).

![Screenshots Account](media/screenshots/screenshots_account.png)

#### Course Registration and Management
- Users can sign up for courses by choosing a course with open registration status from the **Courses** page and filling out the sign up form. Users can choose if they want to participate in the whole course or select single sessions. The course fee will be calculated automatically, depending on the selection. Users can also apply for a grading exam. The exam grade will be stored with the registration according to the user's current grade.
- After signing up for a course, users can see their current registrations on the **My Registrations** page. They can update or cancel their registrations, if they wish.

- Upon logging in for the first time after a course with an exam application has passed, the user will be asked to confirm if they have passed their exam.

![Screenshots Course Registration](media/screenshots/screenshots_exam_passed.png)

#### Website UX
- The website has a responsive navigation menu accessible from all pages.
- The start page presents the user with an image slideshow and general information about the organization. Furthermore, the start page features a list of upcoming courses, so that users can immediately see, which courses are available to sign up for.
- There are several other pages available providing detailed information about Aikido, about the organization. Also, visitors, who are interested in learning Aikido can get information on where to start.
- Finally there is a contact page available from the websites footer. Upon submitting the contact form, an email is send to the organization with the user's message.

#### Staff functions
##### Course and Registration Management
- Staff members can manage courses and course registrations from the Django admin site. They can create new courses, update existing courses and see a list of registrations for each course.
- They can also update registrations, for example to update the payment status.
- There are actions available for duplicating courses (in order to minimize the effort for creating new courses, which are similar to existing courses) and for toggling a course's registration status.

![Screenshots Course Registration](media/screenshots/screenshots_admin_courses.png)

##### Content Management
- Staff users can also create new pages or edit existing pages in order to update the website's content.
- Pages are assigned a category and newly created pages will be automatically appear in the main navigation in the appropriate menu item. The order in which pages and categories appear in the navigation can be controlled by assigning a menu position value.
- The page content can be edited with a WYSIWIG editor, which allows for styling and also image upload.

### Future Features
- The following features have not been implemented in the current scope of the project, but could be worth considering for future iterations:
  - Add a breadcrumb navigation to the website in order to further improve user experience.
  - Update a course's registration status automatically based on a registration period. This would require some task scheduling solution on the server, like [Cron](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Cron/).
  - Limit the final fee of a course registration so that the fee for multiple sessions never exceeds the fee for the entire course.
  - Add the option to upload a PDF file or an image as attachment with a course.
  - Add a form for signing up for a membership with the organization.
  - Allow staff users to download course registration data as a CSV file.
- Furthermore, all [user stories, which were not part of the current scope of the project](#user-stories-not-included-in-current-scope), could be reevaluated and considered for future iterations. 

## Design Process

This project was designed with a user-centered approach, keeping the five planes of user experience in mind.

### Strategy Plane

The website's target audience are members of the Aikido organization DANBW. The aim is to provide an easy and intuitive way for members to sign up for courses and manage their course registrations. At the same time, the project wants to make managing courses and registrations as simple as possible for staff members.

The project aims to provide a central platform for DANBW members, which engages its users and offers a positive user experience. This should be part of a strong sense of community, which is an important aspect of DANBW.

### Scope Plane

### Structure Plane

The project is built around two main models: Courses and Users. What the website is supposed to do, essentially, is to connect those to models. The connection between those two models is provided by Course Registrations as an intermediary model.

The relationships between the models used in the project is represented in the following entity relationship diagrams:

### Skeleton Plane

The overall layout of the website stays close to the [existing website](https://www.danbw.de) in order to make the transition from the old to the new version as user-friendly as possible.

The website consists of three main sections: A header with the logo, the main title, and the navigation menu, a main section for the content and a footer.

The website is designed to be responsive for all screen sizes.

The wireframes for the project can be found here: [Wireframes Mobile](media/wireframes/wireframes-mobile.png)
[Wireframes Desktop](media/wireframes/wireframes-desktop.png)

### Surface Plane

Similar to the general layout, the goal of the visual design of the website was to stay close to the design of the original website, while updating and modernizing design elements where adequate.

#### Colors

The project adopts the color scheme of the original website, which is part of the corporate design of the organization.

The color scheme consists of two main colors:

![#1e3c95](https://placehold.co/100x100/1e3c95/1e3c95.png) Primary color: #1e3c95

![#b5172c](https://placehold.co/100x100/b5172c/b5172c.png)  Secondary color: #b5172c

![#f1f1f1](https://placehold.co/100x100/f1f1f1/f1f1f1.png) Tertiary color: #f1f1f1

#### Fonts

The font for the website,[Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3), is the same as on the existing website in order to provide visual coherence.

#### Logo

The organizations logo has been slightly updated for this project to make it fit better to the more modern look of the website:
